```javascript
// pages/index.js

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my Next.js app!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Solution:**
The issue in this case was a transient problem with the Next.js build system.  While the exact cause remains elusive, the solution in most cases will be one of the following:

1. **Clear the Next.js cache:** Delete the `.next` directory in your project root.
2. **Check your package.json:** Ensure the `next` version you are using is up to date and the relevant dependencies are compatible.
3. **Restart the build process:** A simple restart of the build process may resolve the issue in some cases. 
4. **Check for conflicting plugins:** If you have any custom plugins, temporarily disable them to verify that they aren't interfering with the build. 
5. **Reinstall packages:** Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to reinstall your project dependencies. 

If the problem persists after trying these steps, provide more context of your project such as the `package.json`, next.config.js, and relevant portions of code for further investigation.
